Use a text editor to create the C source code
    gedit hello.c
    vi <filename>
    vim <filename>

Compile the program.
    gcc -o hello hello.c
    
Execute the program.
	./hello
	
Optional step
In order to avoid the. / prefix each time a program is to be executed, insert the following as the last line in the file .profile (located in your home folder):
export PATH=.:$PATH
This step needs only to be done once.
